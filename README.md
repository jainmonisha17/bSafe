# Abstract

"bSafe" is a safety application addressing global women's safety concerns, featuring alert messaging, auto-calling, and GPS-based location sharing. Its self-defense and SMS alert functionalities ensure swift aid by notifying guardians and providing nearby police station details.

# Problem 
In today’s world, it is not safe for a person to travel alone at night, especially for
women. Security alert apps on smartphones mitigate risks for solo travelers, especially women, against crimes like robbery and assault, addressing the concerning rise in incidents reported by the National Crime Records Bureau of India.

# Proposed Solution 

This app aims to ensure women's safety via smartphones, recognizing the ubiquity of mobile devices in modern life. Despite legislative efforts following cases like Delhi's Nirbhaya, women's crime rates persist, emphasizing the importance of proactive safety measures over-reliance solely on legal reforms.
