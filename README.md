# bSafe
Android application that sends an emergency message, along with location to guardians in case of distress.

# Abstract

Safety for women has become a significant issue as day-by-day cases increase
all over the world. This proposed project explains women's safety and security by
using an application to send alert messages, auto-call primary guardians, send
current locations, and alert authorities. It suggests a replacement view to use
technology to guard women. I'm calling this app "bSafe". In this project, an
android-based smartphone with this app installed alerts and provides
location-based messages to guardians.
It provides self-defense and SMS alerts when a woman is in danger. The
recognition will happen when the volume up button is pressed for 10 seconds. It
will recognize this and send an alert message to guardians with (GPS) Global
positioning system location. This will also show nearby police station details
based on the GPS location. The location tracking system is an important part of
this project since it ensures that help is on the way for the victim.

# Problem 
In today’s world, it is not safe for a person to travel alone at night, especially for
women. It will be high time to travel alone because a woman is not highly strong as men to
protect themselves from them. A good way to reduce the chances of becoming a victim of
violent crime(robbery, sexual assault, rape, domestic violence) is to identify and call on
resources to help out in unsafe situations. Whether you are in instant trouble or got
separated from friends during the night and do not know to reach home, having these apps
on your phone can diminish your risk and bring assistance when you require it.
We can present a Security alert application for smart, android phones working over the
android platform. The National Crime Records Bureau of India reported incidents of crime
against women have increased by 15.3% in 2021, and a crime against women is
committed every three minutes. 65% of Indian men believe women should tolerate
violence in order to keep the family together.

# Proposed Solution 

Our main motto in developing this app is to provide a safe environment to women
through smartphones as today most people are carrying smartphones wherever they go.
Of course, the Delhi Nirbhaya case has made the Government make the laws tougher, but
even though the crime rate of women has not decreased. So it is better to take our own
safety measures rather than becoming a victim of those crimes.

# Project Scope

Android application development is utilized to develop this app. This app ensures the
safety of women. it helps to identify and call on resources to help one out of dangerous
situations. These reduce risk and bring assistance when we are in danger helping us to
send the location to the contacts.

# Operational Feasibility

1. It works even if the screen is locked.
2. It works even if other apps are being used.
3. This app won’t ask for any specific user details like phone number, email address.
4. Privacy is more concern as it is privacy first app.
5. Shake detection for calling guardians in case of distress.
6. No changes for other existing applications.
7. Users just need an android phone, internet connection, and location access to make it operational.
